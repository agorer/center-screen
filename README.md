# Center Screen

Center the screen on the selected line, like `zz` in vim.

You can center the screen by:
* Choosing `Center Screen: Center Screen` from the command palette
* Right click on the line you want to center, and choose `Center Screen` from the context menu
* Define a keyboard shortcut, for example:
```
'.editor':
    'ctrl-alt-z': 'center-screen:center-screen'
```
